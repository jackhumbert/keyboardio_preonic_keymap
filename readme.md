# Jack's Keyboardio Preonic Keymap

This uses a [currently-out-of-tree `Layer.insert` feature](https://github.com/jackhumbert/Kaleidoscope/tree/f/insert_layer), along with the `Kaleidoscope-Shifter` plugin included to modify the normal shift (left-thumb) behavior for a couple keys.

The Makefile expects you to have defined `KALEIDOSCOPE_DIR` or have your installation in a sibling directory relative to this one.
